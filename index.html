   		<td>Piece 1: I chose my favorite animal to inspire the creation of this creature. This animal possesses butterfly wings, which allow it to fly. By giving my creature a bearded dragon lower body and giving it a rabbit head and butterfly wings, I was able to transform it into a hybrid. It is a forest animal.
</td>
   		<td>Piece 2: I created this project with Adobe photoshop. We have been experimenting with it during my art class. We learned how to use shapes and colors to create these effects. Shadows and shading to give it some dimension. The shape I chose was a rose. I used 8. I did 4 pink roses and 4 yellow roses. After duplicating and rotating I started to see the mandala form. It was really awesome seeing the colors and roses turn trippy.
</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: I created this photo kaleidoscope by choosing an image and rotating it. There were a lot of steps like copying the image so it looks like a mirror. After copying them it looked like 4 of the same pictures but rotating them made it into a kaleidoscope. It made me realize that all the steps were worth the wait because my design looked so amazing.
