   		<td>Piece 1: I chose my favorite animal to inspire the creation of this creature. This animal possesses butterfly wings, which allow it to fly. By giving my creature a bearded dragon lower body and giving it a rabbit head and butterfly wings, I was able to transform it into a hybrid. It is a forest animal.
</td>
   		<td>Piece 2: I created this project with Adobe photoshop. We have been experimenting with it during my art class. We learned how to use shapes and colors to create these effects. Shadows and shading to give it some dimension. The shape I chose was a rose. I used 8. I did 4 pink roses and 4 yellow roses. After duplicating and rotating I started to see the mandala form. It was really awesome seeing the colors and roses turn trippy.
</td>
   		<td>Piece 3: The celebrity I chose for this project is an amazing artist. Her name is Jhene Aiko. She's a very beautiful and inspirational artist. I liked the pose because it shows her pretty eyes. The colors matched her tiny face. The tools I used were the fill and foreground. Overall, I am very proud of my work.
